slightly different syntax for reading from the keyboard (raw_input),

printing (a statement, not a function), and they use an old form of

Assistance

(free!):</p>



<p>Tutoring hours by Computer Science TA's (generally

first-come-first-serve) is posted at

<a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/cs/academics/tutoring/">http://www.luc.edu/cs/academics/tutoring/</a>.

It should start by the second or third week of the semester. Your best

choices for help are the professor and TA for the course, but all TA's

should be familiar with most of the course topics. If any tutors you

visit are NOT familiar with Python, let me know right away!</p>



<p>The university supports an official Tutoring Center in the Sullivan

Center. Their phone extension is 8-7708. Their web site is

<a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/tutoring">http://www.luc.edu/tutoring</a>.

You may

need to make appointments in advance for university tutoring. When

consulting the university tutoring center hours, remember that, at

most, tutors

for Comp 150 are only available during some of those times, due

to the personal schedule of the tutor(s).&nbsp; In general, COMP

students have done better with the department's tutoring service.<br>

</p>



<p><br>

</p>



<p><a name="sakai"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sakai:</span></p>



<p>As of this writing, Sakai will be used for course announcements,

homework submissions, and grade postings.&nbsp; While the raw scores

posted on Sakai should be correct (although I have encountered some

problems with that too!), please do not rely upon Sakai's Course Total

calculations.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Grades are

calculated as specified in this

syllabus!!</span>&nbsp; <br>

</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="format"></a>Course Format:</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">There

is recent evidence that

with all the online

resources available, a hybrid approach is useful for on-campus

courses.&nbsp; The approach I plan to mostly be doing with you is

called </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;">flipping</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">:&nbsp; flip

when you get most of your presentations and do much of your homework,

so the presentations are mostly at your convenience, at your speed, as

videos/text on your computer or in a lab, and then in class discuss

questions you had on the presentations and do much of the harder

creative work of synthesizing and using this information, when you have

the most direct support from me, TA's, and classmates.&nbsp; Please

give me feedback on how this is going and what you think would improve

your experience!</span></p>



<p>There will be an in-class mini-lecture to introduce&nbsp; new

topics.&nbsp; In addition, if three people ask the same question, I

will offer an explanation to the class on that topic.&nbsp; In general,

if you feel that you can benefit from more explanation, sit on the same

side as the instructor's desk&nbsp; If you would prefer to continue

working on your own, sit on the opposite side of the room.&nbsp; In

this way, those students who want additional lecture support can have

it with minimal intrusion to those students who would prefer to work on

their own.</p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">For

the non-Python topics, there will be short demonstrations/labs in

class, in which you are expected to participate.<br>

</span></p>



<p style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: italic;">You are responsible

for

what

goes on in class, even if some of the activity&nbsp;may not be

covered in the class notes. </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">If

you choose not to attend, that is your prerogative; however, make sure

that you find out what you missed.</span><br>

</p>



<p>I am expecting you to look at assigned presentations before

class,

but <span style="font-style: italic;">if you want to

check on

something in a video during class, remember to bring headphones!</span>&nbsp;

To avoid bothering others in labs, the lab machine sound only works

through separate speakers.&nbsp; (Use headphones if you listen

on&nbsp;

your own notebook computer in class, too.)<br>

</p>



<p>Class time is valuable and in short supply, so there are some

tradeoffs in this approach.&nbsp; You cannot immediately get a

question

answered by me in the middle of a video presentation.&nbsp; That is

offset by the fact that there are several days at least to take in the

videos, so if you attend to them early, you have time to get emailed

feedback before you finish viewing.&nbsp; It would be helpful if

you kept a list of questions as you watch the videos. &nbsp;You may

find that some of your questions will be answered as you continue to

wathc the videos, and some you will want to bring to class.</p>



<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Cell Phones: </span>Only you know

the relative importance of any particular

cell phone call, and whether it is important for you to answer a call

imediately rather than later. I do want you to be respectful of my

class and disrupt it as little as is practical. If you get cell phone

calls with fair frequency, be sure to have the ring muted before coming

to class. If you rarely get calls, you might not mute it ahead, and

your cell phone may happen to ring. Get rid of the noise as soon as

possible, and do not get flustered. I assume you will move outside the

classroom for a conversation. If you get fairly frequent calls that you

are likely to consider important answering, sit in a place where your

exit and re-entrance are as unobtrusive as possible.<br>

</p>



<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="assignments"></a>Homeworks/Assignments:</span>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Programming

Assignments: &nbsp;</span>For each tutorial, you must submit to Sakai a

zip file of the required exercises for that chapter.&nbsp; The

exercises are mentioned as you encounter them in the tutorials.&nbsp;

In addition, a list of the exercises and the due dates for each

assignment are linked to on the <a target="_blank" href="#schedule">Course

Schedule</a>.<br>

</p>



<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Homework Assignments:</span>

&nbsp;There are also several non-programming homework assignments.

&nbsp;The links to these homeworks and their due dates are on the

Course Schedule(below).&nbsp; Pip Program (assembly-language

programming) and Logic Gates are listed.&nbsp; We may also have an

additional assignment on database queries.<br>

</p>



<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Pair Programming:</span> &nbsp;It

has been demonstrated recently that Pair Programming, two

people collaborating on one problem with one person coding while the

other looks on, whether beginner

students or seasoned professionals, allows projects been done

better&nbsp;and faster with more confidence, and also that

students&nbsp;learn at least as well and have more&nbsp;enjoyment in

the process. &nbsp;We will have the option to do pair programming in

this course for in-class work and programing assignments. &nbsp;(Your

exams

will NOT be in pairs however!) &nbsp;Read the page on <a target="_blank" href="How_to_Pair_Program.html">how

to make pair programming work</a> and also the page of <a target="_blank" href="Pair_Programming_Admin.html">administrative

guidelines</a> for pair programming (mostly for when it does not work

out as planned!).&nbsp;</p>



<span style="font-style: italic;">Project:</span>

&nbsp;You will form teams of two or three, to complete a project, which

is a major programming assignment in Python.&nbsp; Some suggestions for the project can be found <a href="HW/Project.html">here.</a> This will be discussed further in class.<br>



<br>



<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">--&gt;Important

note about team submissions:&nbsp;</span>

If I announce that an assignment may be worked on in a team (for

instance, pair programming), each team member must submit something on

Sakai.&nbsp; If you are the team member submitting the assignment, you

must also submit a note in the Assignment comment box on Sakai, listing

each team member for whom you are submitting the assignment.&nbsp; If

someone else is submitting the assignment, you must submit a note in

the Assignment comment box telling me who is submitting the assignment

for your team.&nbsp; Do not assume that just because your team member

submitted the assignment that you will automatically get credit.&nbsp;

You MUST submit a comment letting me know that it was submitted on your

behalf. <br>



<big><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">--&gt;Even

more important note about the group project:&nbsp;</span></big>

You are expected to fully participate in the group project.&nbsp; Your

individual grade may be modified depending upon your contribution to

the project and your cooperative and substantive participation.&nbsp;

This will be assessed by instructors walk-throughs during class and by

the Team Pariticpation form completed by each team member.<br>



<br>



<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="env"></a>Programming

Environment: </span><br>



We will be programming in Python, available in the University Windows

labs, and as a download to your own computer. There are several choices

based on program version and operating system. You should get Python

version 3.3.2 or greater for your operating system from the central

site www.python.org/download. Mac users, also see this page that is

referenced on the download page - you may need a second download,

Python comes with the graphical interface, Idle, which we will use. The

latest version for Windows and Mac is 3.4.<br>



<br>



<br>



<br>



Flash Drives or other storage<br>



<br>



The University computers labs provide Computer Science students with

permanent storage on P: drive. If you use both computer lab machines

and other machines, or just share with a partner, you will want to take

all of your files with you. You have several alternatives:<br>



<br>



Get a USB 2.0+ flash drive** ($5-$30 depending on the capacity) and use

it every time you are in the lab. It takes almost no time to insert and

remove, and it will have everything in one place.<br>



<br>



Flash drive are very small, like a finger, and that makes them easy to

forget and leave behind. I have gotten a flash drive returned to me

several times because I write my email address on the outside of it. I

suggest you do the same.<br>



<br>



Save on some Internet site like Box or Google Drive.<br>



<br>



In a pinch, send email to yourself with attachments.<br>



<br>



<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="honesty"></a>Academic

Honesty: </span><br>



<br>



The penalty for cheating may be anywhere from a 0 on an assignment to a

grade of "F" in this course. The appropriate dean will be informed in

writing of any cheating incidents. No exceptions, for any reason.&nbsp;

Students are expected to have read the university's <a href="http://www.luc.edu/academics/catalog/undergrad/reg_academicintegrity.shtml">statement

on academic integrity</a>.

This policy applies to the course, except that the minimum penalty is a

0 (not an F) on the assignment. &nbsp; The Academic Grievance procedure

is

listed&nbsp; <a href="http://www.luc.edu/academics/catalog/undergrad/reg_academicgrievance.shtml">here</a>.<br>



<br>



Cheating consists of, but is not limited to:<br>



<ul>



  <li>Using or copying an outside person's work on an exam or

assignment in any fashion. "Outside person" includes a person who put

something on a web page. It has become depressingly familiar for me,

most every semester, meting out penalties for using someone else's work

on the web. Do not do it.</li>

</ul>



<ul>



  <li>Work includes outlines, pseudocode, code, and documentation.</li>

</ul>



<ul>



  <li>Allowing your own work to be copied or used by an outside person.</li>

</ul>



<ul>



  <li>Submitting as your own work something that has been written by an

outside person (or web site).</li>

</ul>



<ul>



  <li>Using any unauthorized reference on an exam or assignment</li>

</ul>



<ul>



  <li>Not acknowledging and describing in writing on an assignment any

help you received or gave.</li>

</ul>



<ul>



  <li>If you are working on a pair or group project, an "outside

person" only refers to people other than your assigned partner or team.</li>

</ul>



<ul>



  <li>Note that cheating goes both ways: both giving and receiving.</li>

</ul>



<ul>



  <li>Consultation is allowed with the tutors and with me. If you

consult with the tutors and/or with me, still make a comment at the top

of your work about the substance and depth of the help.</li>

</ul>



<br>



Help from any source is fine concerning<br>



<ul>



  <li>The meaning of program specifications (not the plan for the

solution or the actual solution).</li>

  <li>The tools used to write programs. Feel free to ask questions on

the programming environment you use and the use of the debugger.</li>

  <li>The restrictions of the current programming language syntax.</li>

</ul>



<br>



<br>



<br>



<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="exams"></a>Exams:</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>&nbsp; There are three exams.&nbsp;

Tentative dates are:<br>



<ul>



  <li>Exam #1:&nbsp; 9/28 and 9/30<br>

  </li>

  <li>Exam #2:&nbsp; 10/28 and 10/30<br>

  </li>

  <li>Final Exam:&nbsp; as per the Loyola University Final Exam

Schedule.&nbsp; 12/11, 9:00 - 11:00 a.m.<br>

  </li>

</ul>



Exams will cover material discussed in class, reading material on

the

web, and assignments. Exams will always be cumulative.&nbsp;

You are allowed at&nbsp; two 8.5 x 11 inch sides of notes for

exams, but no computer or calculator. I emphasize having you process

and use

information, not regurgitate facts -- put the facts you most forget and

still need in your notes. This is very different than many of the

requirements some students had in high school, where fact recall may

have been key. What you want most to remember is general patterns about

the process of breaking problems into pieces and identifying the right

process for each piece. The pieces may come in all sorts of

combinations, so remembering whole rote sequences is not likely to be

helpful. Do not depend on it.<br>



<br>



There is a review for each exam posted on the Course Schedule.<br>



<br>



<p>If you must miss an exam, let me know well in advance. Then if you

have

a good reason we can possibly make other arrangements. I have little

sympathy for people who inform me after the fact for no good reason.

Exam absences will be veririfed.&nbsp; If they can't be verified, you

will not be excused.&nbsp; <br>

</p>



<p><strong>*No second try*</strong>: If you have an excuse for not

being prepared to

take an exam, but decide to take it anyway, you don't get to change

your

mind after you see a poor grade. Being sick is not a way to get one

more

chance than everyone else. I may allow you to delay an exam due to

illness, but I will not let you be reexamined due to a poor grade.</p>



<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="religious_holidays"></a>Religious

Holidays:</span>

<p>Students with religious holiday conflicts:&nbsp; Please let me know

within the first two weeks of class if you have a religious holiday

conflict with any exam or homework due date, so that we can plan on a

makeup schedule.<br>

</p>



<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="disabilities"></a>Students

with Disabilities:&nbsp; </span>If you have a documented disability

and wish to discuss academic accommodations, please contact the

Services for Students with Disabilities Office (773-508-3700 and

SSWD@luc.edu) as soon as possible.<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;

</span>Students with documented disabilities who provide me with a

letter from the SSWD office will be fully accommodated as per the terms

of the letter.&nbsp; Students who are allowed to take their exams in

the SSWD office are encouraged to do so.&nbsp; Should you choose to

take the exam in the classroom, I cannot guarantee that the classroom

environment will be quiet enough to provide you with the environment

that your disability may require.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<span style="font-weight: bold;">Students

with Sponsorships and Scholarships:&nbsp;</span>

If you require a certain

grade in order to satisfy a sponsor or a scholarship requirement,

please be sure to monitor your grade on Sakai.&nbsp; I will consider

only your performance in this course in calculating grades, using the

grading rubric posted in this syllabus.&nbsp; If you cannot achieve a

minimum grade that is required by a sponsor or a scholarship, I will

not change your grade to help you meet that requirement.&nbsp; This

would be unfair to other students, and not reflecive of your

performance in this course.&nbsp; You are reponsible to monitor your

grade and to keep apprised of the <a href="#dates">withdrawal dates</a>

posted by the registrar.<br>

Components:</p>



<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Tutorial and Videos: </span>&nbsp;An

important component of this course

involves programming using the Python language. &nbsp;We will be using

the Hand-on Python Tutorials designed specifically for this course by

Professor Andrew Harrington. &nbsp;The tutorials are availabe in PDS

format (you may print them), or browsable format online. &nbsp;The

accompanying videos are numbered to match the section numbers in the

tutorials. &nbsp;Example files are referenced in the tutorials, and you

may download them <a href="http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/examples.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
