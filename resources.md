There is no specific text for this course. Rather, we will be using
resource materials available online:

- For the Python component of the course, we will be using the <a target="_blank" href="http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/index.html">Hands-on
Python Tutorial</a> designed specifically for this course by Loyola Professor Andrew Harrington. It is available on the web, both in <a href="http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/index.html" target="_blank">browsable</a>
format and in <a href="http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/Hands-onPythonTutorial.pdf" target="_blank">printable pdf</a> format. This is the closest thing that we have to a text for this course.
- Example files are referenced in the tutorials, and you may download them <a href="http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/examples.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.
- Videos, where most all of the course content are discussed, have
download links on <a href="https://luc.box.com/comp150video">box.com</a>
as well as <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/cs.luc.edu/#folders/0B5WvvnDHeaIYMGE2MzU4OWEtYzQ4Zi00YzhiLTliMTItNjRjYzMyYzgyMTk2" target="_blank">google</a>. These were also prepared by
Professor Harrington. You can find links and instructions <a href="http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/context.html#using-the-tutorial-text-and-video" target="_blank">here</a>.

other course components are linked to from the <a href="http://hwheeler01.github.io/comp150/syllabus/#schedule">Course Schedule</a>.

but in online book form, to greater depth in a somewhat different order
with a different

##Free Tutoring Assistance

- Computer Science Department:
  - Department Drop-in Tutoring Schedule: <a href="http://www.luc.edu/cs/people/tutors/">http://cs.luc.edu/academics/services/tutoring</a>.  
  - Tutoring hours by Computer Science TAs (generally
first-come-first-serve) should start by the second or third week of the semester. 
  - Your best choices for help are the professor and TA for the course, but all TAs
should be familiar with most of the course topics. If any tutors you
visit are NOT familiar with Python, let me know right away!</p>

- The university supports an official Tutoring Center in the Sullivan
Center.  
  - Their phone extension is 8-7708. Their web site is
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/tutoring">http://www.luc.edu/tutoring</a>.
  - You may need to make appointments in advance for university tutoring. When
consulting the university tutoring center hours, remember that, at
most, tutors for COMP 150 are only available during some of those times, due
to the personal schedule of the tutors. In general, COMP
students have done better with the department's tutoring service.<br>
