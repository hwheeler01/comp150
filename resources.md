There
is no specific text for this course. &nbsp;Rather, we will be using
resource materials available online.
<ul>

  <li>For the Python
component of the course, we will be using&nbsp;The <a target="_blank" href="http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/index.html">Hands-on
Python Tutorials</a>
designed specifically for this course by Professor Andrew Harrington.
&nbsp;They are available on the web, both in <a href="http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/index.html" target="_blank">browsable</a>
format and in <a href="http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/Hands-onPythonTutorial.pdf" target="_blank">printable pdf&nbsp;</a> format. &nbsp;&nbsp;
This is the closest thing that we have to a text for this course.&nbsp;
Other Python resources are at the home site for Python: <a href="http://python.org">http://python.org.</a></li>
</ul>

<ul>

  <li>Videos, where most all of the course content are discussed, have
download links on <a href="https://luc.box.com/comp150video">box.com</a>
as well as <a href="https://drive.google.com/a/cs.luc.edu/#folders/0B5WvvnDHeaIYMGE2MzU4OWEtYzQ4Zi00YzhiLTliMTItNjRjYzMyYzgyMTk2" target="_blank">google</a>.&nbsp; These were also prepared by
Professor Harrington.&nbsp; You can find links and instructions in <a href="http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/context.html#using-the-tutorial-text-and-video" target="_blank">http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/context.html#using-the-tutorial-text-and-video</a>.
There is a folder for<span style="font-style: italic;">

Python
Tutorial are intended for people with no programming background.
&nbsp;The others, however, tend to be for Python 2.X, which has
slightly different syntax for reading from the keyboard (raw_input),
printing (a statement, not a function), and they use an old form of
&nbsp;division where / can mean either the // or / of Python 3.2,
depending on the types involved.

Assistance
(free!):</p>

<p>Tutoring hours by Computer Science TA's (generally
first-come-first-serve) is posted at
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/cs/academics/tutoring/">http://www.luc.edu/cs/academics/tutoring/</a>.
It should start by the second or third week of the semester. Your best
choices for help are the professor and TA for the course, but all TA's
should be familiar with most of the course topics. If any tutors you
visit are NOT familiar with Python, let me know right away!</p>

<p>The university supports an official Tutoring Center in the Sullivan
Center. Their phone extension is 8-7708. Their web site is
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.luc.edu/tutoring">http://www.luc.edu/tutoring</a>.
You may
need to make appointments in advance for university tutoring. When
consulting the university tutoring center hours, remember that, at
most, tutors
for Comp 150 are only available during some of those times, due
to the personal schedule of the tutor(s).&nbsp; In general, COMP
students have done better with the department's tutoring service.<br>
