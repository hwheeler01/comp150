###How to Pair Program
This summary is derived from &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://webpages.cs.luc.edu/~cnaiman/COMP150/Kindergarten.pdf">All
I Really
Need to Know about Pair Programming I Learned in Kindergarten.</a>&#8221;,
by Laurie A. Williams Robert R. Kessler.&nbsp;
You are welcomed to read the full paper. &nbsp;It starts with lots
of data supporting
the use of pair
programming, some of it with computer jargon you do not need to worry
about as
beginning programmers. &nbsp;It elaborates on many of the points
more than I do in the summary.<br>
<b><br>
Share
everything.</b> &nbsp;All
contributions, whether leading to great
results or errors, are &#8220;ours&#8221;, not
&#8220;yours&#8221; or &#8220;mine&#8221;.</p>
<p><b>Play
fair.</b> &nbsp;One
person &#8220;drives&#8221; (has control of
the keyboard or is recording design ideas) while the other is
continuously
reviewing the work and planning ahead.&nbsp;Even when one
programmer is
significantly more experienced than the other, it is important to take
turns
&#8220;driving,&#8221; lest the observer become disjoint, feel
out of the loop or
unimportant.&nbsp; The
person not driving is
not a passive observer, instead is always active and engaged, checking
over the work and thinking ahead.</p>
<p><b>Don&#8217;t
hit your partner.</b> &nbsp;But
make sure your partner stays
focused and on-task. </p>
<p><b>Put
things back
where they belong. &nbsp;</b>Put negative
judgments in the
trash:&nbsp; Be positive
about you and your
partner.&nbsp; For both,
this is an
opportunity to improve.</p>
<p><b>Clean
up your
mess. &nbsp;</b>Watch over the
shoulder and you are
really likely to find a large number of your errors!</p>
<p><b>Don&#8217;t
take things too seriously.</b> &nbsp;If
your partner picks out a bunch of
errors as you type, be glad there are two of you.&nbsp; But
do not always
agree.&nbsp; Have healthy
disagreement/debate.&nbsp; Finding
the fine
balance takes adjustment.</p>
<p><b>Say
you&#8217;re sorry when you hurt
somebody while moving furniture.</b> &nbsp;Sit
side-by-side and program,
simultaneously viewing the computer screen and swap&nbsp;the
keyboard and
mouse back and forth.&nbsp; Slide the
keyboard -- don't move
the chairs.</p>
<p><b>Wash
your hands
of skepticism before
you start.</b>
&nbsp;Being skeptical can be a
self-fulfilling prophesy.&nbsp; Buying
in and
&#8220;jelling&#8221; as a team can lead to a whole that is greater than
the sum of the parts. </p>
<p><b>Flush.</b> &nbsp;If
you work on some parts
independently either discard them (flush) and start over together or
have the
partner very carefully review the work with you.</p>
<p><b>Warm
cookies
and cold milk are good
for you.</b>&nbsp;
Periodically, taking a break is
important for maintaining the stamina for another round of productive
pair
programming. </p>
<p><b>Be
aware of the
power of two brains.</b>
&nbsp;Experience show that, together, a
pair will come up with more than twice as many possible solutions than
the two
would have working alone. They will then proceed to more quickly narrow
in on
the &#8220;best&#8221; solution and will implement it more
quickly and with better quality.

###Rules and Procedures for Comp 150
Remember, you are being allowed to complete your programming assignments and labs with a partner ONLY as long as you do it following the principles of “pair programming” as described above.  

Each partner should “drive” roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and at most 25% of an individual’s effort for an assignment should be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer must be reviewed by the pair together. The object is to work together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

You are free to select any other student from your class to be your partner. Make sure that both names appear on all work submitted by the pair. 

You should make a reasonable attempt to remain with the same partner for the entire class. Research studies have shown that it can take several weeks for a pair to gel and begin working well together. Changing partners interferes with this gelling process.

If your partner doesn't show up to a scheduled programming session, you may complete the assignment yourself. You should clearly document what happened both in the program comments and in the comment field of the `log.txt` file you submit.
