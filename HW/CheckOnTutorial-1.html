<p>45 points</p>
<p>Work through Chapter 1 of the <a href="http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/">Hands-on
Python Tutorial</a>. &nbsp; Caution: &nbsp;Do not judge
your progress
through the chapter just by the number of pages you have read or
minutes of video! &nbsp;The
exercises and the more difficult parts of the chapter are clustered
at the end!&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>Here is the list of files you need to make sure are included
when
you turn in your Chapter 1 work. If you saved this work under some
other name, please rename as I specify below. &nbsp;The point
distribution for the problems is also shown. &nbsp;To receive full
credit on a program, it needs to run correctly, as written.&nbsp;
Run and check carefully!<br>

<p>For simplicity, please submit into the Ch1Tutorial Blackboard
assignment just a single archive that includes these files.&nbsp;
Remember to include information about help you received and gave in
individual
files. </p>
<p>I suggest you just keep your specially named exercise files in
with
all the example files. When it is time to submit exercise files, here
is the process in Windows:<br>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the examples folder (or the folder where you have the
files).</li>
<li>Look at the list of required files in this homeworkand
select them <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span>
carefully (Control-click on each one).</li>
<li>Be careful not to do a plain regular left-click.&nbsp;
Instead <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">right</span>
click on the selected files, and in the popup menu choose Send To
--&gt; Compressed (zipped) folder<br>
</li>
<li>A zip file should be created based on the name of the file
your mouse was over when you right clicked.</li>
<li>Upload that zip file into the Blackboard assignment.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><i>In addition</i>, every individual should
separately submit a personal
file log.txt.&nbsp; This should be a plain text file with exactly
this name.&nbsp; (You can create it in Idle if you like.) <b>Your
homework grade will not be recorded
without this file!</b> &nbsp;Include in log.txt: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Roughly how long you
worked for Chapter 1 beyond class time. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Briefly, what was the
hardest part to get, how did it go for you ... </p>
</li>
<li>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Who your partner was if
you had one, or "No partner" &nbsp;If you changed partners,
indicate which files were produced with which partner, if possible. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If
you had a partner, give an indication of how things went with your
partner. &nbsp;Was working together a good thing?&nbsp; How did
your
partner help? How did you help your partner?&nbsp; Did you work
together remotely online?&nbsp; How did it go?<br>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you worked with a consistent partner through the whole
chapter,
only one of you needs to submit the archive, but make sure each
partner has their own copy! Each student should separately submit an
<i>independently</i> written log file. &nbsp;</p>
