<p>Work through the following sections of Chapter 2 in the <a href="http://www.cs.luc.edu/~anh/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml">Hands-on
Python Tutorial</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Object Orientation &nbsp;2.1.1</li>
<li>&lt;intervening sections optional&gt;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Appending to a List 2.2.1</li>
<li>&lt;intervening sections optional&gt;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Graphics, 2.4, except for 2.4.3 (.pyw), 2.4.4 (events), and
2.4.9 (Entry objects),&nbsp; which are optional</li>
<li>Files, 2.5</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember you can check for methods in <a href="http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/graphics.html#the-documentation-for-graphics-py">Zelle's
and my extra graphics documentation</a>. <br>
</p>
<p>Here is the list of files you need make sure are included when
you
turn in your Chapter 2 work. If you saved this work under some
other name, please <span style="font-style: italic;">rename
as I specify</span> below. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>You may skip scene.py (Exercise 2.4.5.1)<span style="font-family: monospace;"></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span>changeScene.py
(Exercise 2.4.5.2) &nbsp;(6 points)</li>
<li>backAndForth4.py (Exercise 2.4.8.1) (6 points)</li>
<li>faces.py (Exercise 2.4.8.2) (6 points)<span style="font-family: monospace;"></span><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span></li>
<li>move2Faces.py (Exercise 2.4.8.3) (7 points)<span style="font-family: monospace;"></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span>ranges.py
(Exercise 2.4.12.1) &nbsp;(6 points)</li>
  <li>An Extra Credit Problem:&nbsp; texttriangle.py (Exercise 2.4.12.2) (3 points)<br>
  </li>

<li><span style="font-family: monospace;"></span>fileUpper.py,
copyFileUpper.py (Exercise 2.5.2.1b,c) (4 points each) (You do not need
to
turn in&nbsp;printUpper.py from part a, though that is a good
initial program to
write.)</li>
<li>madlib3.py, myMadlib.txt (Exercise 2.5.2.2) &nbsp;This
exercise <span style="font-style: italic;">uses</span>
code from the sections we skipped, but you only need to use the
tellStory code, not modify it. &nbsp;You just need to change the
very
bottom of the code where tellStory is called, so you pass in the the
format string taken from the requested file. Then&nbsp;tellStory
finds
the cue strings without you needing to explicitly list them separately
as in the original version. &nbsp;(6 points with both files)</li>
</ul>
<p>For simplicity you may submit a single archive that includes
these
files. &nbsp;Check that they all are included! </p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Same
instructions </span><span style="font-style: italic;">
as before </span><span style="font-style: italic;">for
log.txt:</span>&nbsp; Every individual should separately
submit a personal
file log.txt.&nbsp; This should be a<span style="font-style: italic;"> plain text </span>file
with <span style="font-style: italic;">exactly this name</span>.&nbsp;
(You can create it in Idle if you like.) <b>Your homework grade
will not be recorded
without this file!</b>&nbsp; Include in the file <br>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Roughly how long you worked for Chapter 2 beyond
class time.&nbsp; <br>
</li>
<li>Briefly, how it went for you, for instance what was the
hardest part to get ...</li>
<li>Who your partner was if you had one, or "No partner"
&nbsp;If you
changed partners, indicate which files were produced with which
partner, if possible.</li>
<li>If
you had a partner, give an indication of how things went with your
partner. &nbsp;Was working together a good thing?&nbsp; Did you
work
together remotely online?&nbsp; How did it go?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you worked with a consistent partner through the whole
chapter,
only one of you needs to submit the archive, but make sure both partner
has their own copy! Each student should separately submit an <span style="font-style: italic;">independently</span>
written log file.</p>
