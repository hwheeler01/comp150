<h1>Two Pip programs<br>
</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal">This is a pair assignment worth 60<b style=""> points</b>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>The objective
of this assignment is to
write Pip programs that use jumps to approximate a Python if-else
statement and a while statement.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The program
should begin with&nbsp;comments (starting with ';') including your
names,
a brief description of what the program does and information on any
help you received on
the project.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it
is entirely your own
work, say so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
anyone helped either of you,
identify them by name and describe how they helped.<span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Remember to turn in your work on Sakai. &nbsp;Have one member turn in the files for the
work
and each turn in logs, as for the last assignment.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>
You are to write two separate chunks of Pip code. &nbsp;Call the
files
pipa.asm and pipb.asm, and test each separately in
pipGUI.py. &nbsp;Include the initial required comments at the top
of the
first file. &nbsp;Remember, in assember comment lines start with a
semicolon. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Do not have initial statements to set values for the variables.
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;Instead set
memory values in the simulator before each test of
your chunk of code.</span> &nbsp;(This saves time.)
<h3>Part A &nbsp;An if-else construction (pipa.asm) (25 points)<br>
</h3>
Write Pip assembler code equivalent to the Python below. The easiest
way and most encouraged way is using <span style="font-style: italic;">symbolic</span> code
labels as needed (followed by a colon) and symbolic data names, as
understood by pipGUI.py. &nbsp;You may do it with <span style="font-style: italic;">numeric</span>
data addresses and/or numeric jump addresses as in the book or the
book's applet, but in that case, do make a comment as to what memory
locations represent the x, y, and z of the Python version!<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">if x &lt; 0:</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;
&nbsp; y = y + 2</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">else:</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;
&nbsp; y = x</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">z&nbsp;= y + z</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br>
You are encouraged to <br>
<ul>
<li>write&nbsp;to a file pipa.asm, </li>
<li>load it into pipGUI.py, </li>
<li>give values manually to x, y, and z, </li>
<li>run to test the results. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Press INIT &nbsp;and go back to set new x, y, z values
and test some more...</li>
</ul>
<h3>Part B: &nbsp;Remainder by subtraction (pipb.asm) (35 points)<br>
</h3>
Pip does not have a remainder operation as in Python. &nbsp;One way
to simulate y = y % x with positive x and y is<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">while y &gt;= 0:</span>
&nbsp;<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
y&nbsp;= y - x</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">y&nbsp;= y +
x&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<br>
After the loop, y &lt; 0 for the first time. &nbsp;After the
last line
it is back to the proper range for the remainder:&nbsp;0 &lt;=
y &lt; x. &nbsp; Play computer to see that this works!<br>
Convert that code to Pip assembler file pipb.asm and test as in part
A.&nbsp; The while loop condition translation is trickier here than
in
the earliest while translation example.<br>
