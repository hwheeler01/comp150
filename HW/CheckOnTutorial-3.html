<span style="font-style: italic;">Same instructions as
before for
log.txt:</span>&nbsp; Every individual should
separately submit a personal
file log.txt.&nbsp; This should be a<span style="font-style: italic;">
plain text </span>file with <span style="font-style: italic;">exactly
this name</span>.&nbsp; (You can create it in Idle if you
like.) <b>Your
homework grade will not be recorded
without this file!</b>&nbsp; Include in the log.txt file: <br>
<ol>
<li>Roughly how long you worked for Chapter 3 beyond
class time. &nbsp;Try to separate time on the basic assignment from
any
extra credit you did.</li>
<li>Briefly, how it went for you, for instance what was the
hardest
part to get ...</li>
<li>Who your partner was if you had one, or "No partner"
&nbsp;If you
changed partners, indicate which files were produced with which
partner, if possible.</li>
<li>If
you had a partner, give an indication of how things went with your
partner. &nbsp;Was working together a good thing?&nbsp; Did you
work
together
remotely online?&nbsp; How did it go?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you worked with a consistent partner through the whole
assignment,
only one of you needs to submit the archive, but make sure each partner
has their own copy! Each student should separately submit an <span style="font-style: italic;">independently</span>
written log file.</p>
